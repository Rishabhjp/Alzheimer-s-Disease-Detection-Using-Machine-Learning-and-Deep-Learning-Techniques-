# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques-

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurological disorder. The main reason why older persons 
get dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Machine learning and Deep Learning is 
currently being used to research metabolic disorders like Alzheimer's and diabetes that 
affect a sizable portion of the global population.Each year, their incidence rates are 
rising alarmingly. Neurodegenerative alterations in the brain occur as a result of 
Alzheimer's disease. More people, their families, and the healthcare system will 
encounter diseases that impair memory and functioning as our ageing population grows. 
On the social, financial, and economic fronts, these repercussions will have a significant 
impact. Alzheimer's disease is challenging to anticipate in its early stages. Early AD
treatment is more successful and results in less minor damage than later AD treatment.

The dataset is obtained from an MRI brain picture challenge on the Kaggle website. 
The images are 176 by 208 pixels in size and are grey scale images. There are 
approximately 5000 training images and 1200 test photographs as is. Four categories—
Non-Demented, Very Mildly Demented, Mildly Demented, and Moderately 
Demented—are used to categorise the dataset. Each picture is a cross-sectional 2D MRI 
of the brain. The pictures represent planes of the brain taken from various angles. We 
selected this dataset because to the uniformity of the photos and its big collection of 
photographs..Therefore the proposed work makes use of Machine and Deep Learning
Models on the dataset and classifies out of four categories- Non-Demented, Very Mildly 
Demented, Mildly Demented, and Moderately Demented. The following Machine 
Learning and Deep Learning Learning Algorithms are applied SVM,KNN,ANN,CNN,MobileNet,MobileNetV2,VGG16,VGG19,DenseNet121,Desn
seNet169,ResNet50,InceptionNetV3.The performance of machine learning and deep 
learning models is gauged using metrics including Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and 
F1-score. The comparison in terms of performance parameters is made with all the 
machine learning and deep learning models are applied

It is observed that VGG16 model is the best fit model for Alzheimer 
detection with respect to the dataset with 93.67% accuracy and 0.0727 loss value. The 
model VGG16 is trained for 50 Epochs with data augmentation and 80-20 Train-Test 
data split.
